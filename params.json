This framework is forked from [twbs/bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) as well as [zurb/foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation) (our favorite bits of each) plus some custom junk thrown in for good measure.\r\n\r\n## ITCSS\r\n\r\nThis project follows Inverted Triangle CSS (ITCSS) by Harry \"CSS Wizardry\" Roberts. Files should be organized by groups which are described in detail below. As we go down our list of files we should go from:\r\n\r\n* Generic to explicit\r\n* Far-reaching to localised\r\n* Low specificity to high specificity\r\n\r\nYou may add in new layers to the system, say in between \"components\" and \"trumps\" you can place \"theme\", just make sure you're adding them in the correct place regarding explicitness, reach and specificity. You don't **have** to add in a new layer though, just keep adding files to existing layers as you need them.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nWe are currently using [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for our workflow. This will compile and minify all static files and output them into a folder for distribution.\r\n\r\nTo begin, you must install the dependencies if you haven't already.\r\n\r\n* npm: http://npmjs.org/\r\n* node.js: http://nodejs.org/download/\r\n\r\nOnce npm is installed get your cli up and running and install gulp: `npm install gulp -g`.\r\n\r\nFork this repo if you haven't already and `cd` into your local file where the `package.json` file is located in the root. From there, simply type: `npm install`. This will read the `package.json` file and download all the necessities.\r\n\r\nNow that we're ready, you can start editing the `.scss` files and simply type in `gulp` while sitting pretty in the working folder and it will build everything for you!\r\n\r\nIf you type in `gulp watch`, this will start up a static server at `localhost:5000` pointing to the dist folder. Make an index file, point to the css and you're off to the races.\r\n\r\nThis project is also using [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en), so make sure that's ready too for awesome-sauce.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
